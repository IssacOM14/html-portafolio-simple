<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a recent graduate in Computer Systems Engineering. I have over two years of experience as a fullstack developer and one year as a service desk agent. 
  I'm proficient in languages and tools such as Python, SQL, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Docker, and Kubernetes. During my last semester, I developed a fully functional application that allows users to run open-source LLMs using Ollama. 
  It works as a wrapper that unifies access to all models available on the Ollama Hub.</p>

<p>Based on my experience, hereâ€™s how I usually approach learning a new technology or programming language: First, I read the official documentation and watch tutorials on the most common use cases. 
  Then, I write some simple code to test and implement the technology or practice the new language. If the code fails to compile, I go through it from top to bottom, check the logs and console output, and repeat the process until I get zero errors. 
  Once it works, I apply it in small private projects to get more hands-on experience. Finally, I do A/B testing focused on performance, security, and user experience.</p>
