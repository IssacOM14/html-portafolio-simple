<!-- What exactly is web hosting?  Basically the process of making your website available anywhere in the internet. 
Therefore, someone from America or Asia can access the wesite no matter where they are. In order to make it available to everyone, we need to put our website (the files and data it consist of) 
like index.html, images etc. in a webserver. The webserver is connected to the internet, available 24/7 and anyone can access those file. 
Until this moment, we can see our website locally aka local development. The files and folders are locally available on our computer. For example, if someone wants to access those file, they will 
need to download the files and run them locally (in their own computer). But we do not want this, we need to take our website to a webserver that is hook up to the internet, and this process is known
as web hosting. -->
